# AI-Powered Wildfire Prediction System

Wildfires are unpredictable, fast-moving, and devastating. This project leverages AI-driven ensemble modeling (XGBoost + LSTM) and geospatial analytics to provide early warnings and severity forecasts. Our goal is simple but critical: empower officers, responders, and communities with actionable, real-time insights to reduce risk and save lives.
This repository contains the full pipeline — from data ingestion and model training to an interactive dashboard that visualizes predictions and alerts.
